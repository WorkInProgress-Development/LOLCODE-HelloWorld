## Inspiration
One of the daily challenges was to write hello world in a new language. I've never used lolcat before, so I compiled the [interpreter](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci), and wrote the program.

## What it does
It outputs "Hello World!" to stdout.
But then I was bored, as hello world is so easy, so I made it more complicated!

## How I built it
Reading the [specs doc](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec), and typing some programs which didn't work.

## Challenges I ran into
The interpreter didn't compile on the first attempt.

## What's next for let's use: an esoteric programming language!
I'll try writing something in [whitespace](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424165140/http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/index.php)
